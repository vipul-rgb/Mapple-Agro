Maple Leaves Ltd is a start-up company which makes herbs from different types of plants and its leaves.
Objective: To classify the plant leaves by various classifiers from different metrics of the leaves and to choose the best classifier for future reference.

In this project, I applied various machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes Classifier, to analyze and classify a dataset. The goal was to compare the performance of these algorithms in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. I preprocessed the data by handling missing values, normalizing features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Each algorithm was implemented and fine-tuned to optimize performance. The results were visualized using confusion matrices and ROC curves, providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model. This project demonstrated my ability to leverage different machine learning techniques to solve complex classification problems and draw meaningful conclusions from the data.
